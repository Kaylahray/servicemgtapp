## Overview

StarkNet Service and Management is a dynamic platform designed to simplify the process of connecting service providers with consumers. It addresses common challenges such as finding reliable providers, assessing service quality, and managing bookings efficiently. By creating a centralized marketplace, the platform makes it easy for consumers to browse various services and select those that best meet their needs.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Marketplace**: Browse and select from a diverse range of services with location-based search capabilities
- **Real-time Chat**: Seamless communication between consumers and service providers using Socket.IO
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive rating and review mechanisms ensure reliable service delivery
- **Efficient Booking Management**: Helps service providers expand their reach and coordinate appointments effectively
- **Location-Based Services**: Find service providers near you with customizable search radius

## Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

### Frontend
- Built with **React** for a responsive, modern user interface
- Styled using **Tailwind CSS** and **Material UI** components
- Interactive maps powered by **Mapbox GL**

### Backend
- **Node.js** and **Express** for RESTful API services
- **MongoDB** for persistent data storage
- **Redis** for caching and real-time messaging support
- **Socket.IO** for real-time bidirectional communication

### StarkNet Integration
- Integrated within the StarkNet ecosystem for secure and efficient transactions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm
- MongoDB (local or remote connection)
- Redis (optional, for enhanced real-time features)
- Docker (optional, for running services in containers)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Servora/servicemgtapp.git
   cd servicemgtapp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create an environment file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Update the .env file** with the required configurations:
   - MongoDB connection string
   - Redis connection details
   - JWT secret key
   - Mapbox API token

5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Running in Production

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the production server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Docker Deployment

The application can be run using Docker for consistent deployment across environments:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start all required services including:
- Web frontend
- Service providers API
- Consumers API
- MongoDB database
